Create a javascript application that uses the Open Movie Database to display information about movies. It should satisfy the following user stories:
As a user, I want to enter my search into a text box.
As a user, I want to see search results displayed below my search (anywhere on the page).
As a user, I want the search results to be displayed as I type, so that I can get my results faster and change my query more easily.
As a user, I want to be able to click on a search result to view the details about a particular movie.
Bonus 1: As a user, I want to to see the search results appear directly below (attached to) the search box, like Google does, so I can see my search results more easily
Bonus 2: As a user, I want to use the arrow keys to navigate through the search results and I want to use the enter key to choose a result to display.
You may want to write the project from scratch without re-using any html and css, so that the proejct will present as unique if you show it to anyone in the future.
Commit the project to Github as you work, and submit a link on Schoology when you're done.
Tip: Use keyup instead of submit to fire your events when the user presses a key. -->
